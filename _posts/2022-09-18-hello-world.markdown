After a lot of thinking, I decided to go forward and create this blog. Not gonna lie, this is my first attempt at writting a blog(and Jekyll) and I've got myself against a stresful time. But I made it, and it feels great!

## Why a blog
Simply put, I need a job. For that reason, I already have made this blog, and a Linkedin account, and my Portfolio and... and... Everything seems to fall short. 
Writing a blog in such a "nerd" way would give help me with this matter, plus making me learn new stuff.

At first, I have the feeling this will consume time, yet I hope it will result in a good experience. It should improve my programming insight, English and Web knowledge (probably).

>I got this template for Jekyll from: <a href = "https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll">artemsheludko</a>. I couldn't have done it myself, so he has my most sincere gratitude.

Anyways, I hardly believe you are still here! I am excited about this blog, and that's all that matters now.
