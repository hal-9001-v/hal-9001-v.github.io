This is a WIP Portfolio made in THREE.JS! It will highlight my work, just like in my other standard portfolio post. 

This portfolio's concept revolves around a detective with a report about my works just like I was a criminal. You could switch the pages,
and interact with the scene, drinking some coffee for example.

This is going slowly, mainly due to my limited JS and THREE.JS knowledge (plus 3D art). But hey, I am trying my best.
