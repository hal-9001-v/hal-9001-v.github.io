It may have gone unnoticed, but I had a blog hosted on GitHub Pages for a while! It was based on a Jekyll template, and I was really excited about it. However, after a few months of working as a .NET backend engineer, I decided to recreate the entire thing from scratch.

Since I didn’t fully understand how the template worked, I initially ended up keeping my portfolio as a blog entry, which didn’t quite satisfy me. However, now I’m hosting my portfolio in a way that’s more aligned with my preferences. I also feel more confident about improving the site over time. After all, Blazor is really intuitive for C# developers. My biggest concern is the frontend, but I hope to get better at it as time goes on.

Anyway, welcome to my blog! I plan to share my work here and, hopefully, provide insights and reflections on my projects along the way.
